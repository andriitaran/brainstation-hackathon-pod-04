## PROBLEM

This app was made during 1-day multidisciplinary (Data, Design, Development)hackathon during my diploma program at BrainStation. We were tasked to make a website/web application using technologies we've learned so far by collaborating with students from Data Science and UX/UI programs. Our team was presented with an opportunity to improve the online news popularity for the working professionals on multi-category news websites. We we provided with 40K+ articles from Mashable and a blank canvas. We decided to create an tool that will allow user(content creator) to input his article(title, text, images, hyperlinks, day of posting) and the app will analyze provided content and will determine a level of possible exposure and success of the content. I was de-facto Project Manager who facilitated cross-team collaboration, concept creation and development. Our team successfully completed a challenge and won the hackathon!
